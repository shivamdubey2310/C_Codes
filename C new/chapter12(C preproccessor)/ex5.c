/*
Macros with Arguments
The macros that we have used so far are called simple macros.
Macros can have arguments, just as functions can. Here is an
example that illustrates this fact.

#include<stdio.h>
#define AREA(x) ( 3.14 * x * x )
int main( )
{
    float r1 = 6.25, r2 = 2.5, a ;
    a = AREA ( r1 ) ;
    printf ( "\nArea of circle = %f", a ) ;
    a = AREA ( r2 ) ;
    printf ( "\nArea of circle = %f", a ) ;
}
